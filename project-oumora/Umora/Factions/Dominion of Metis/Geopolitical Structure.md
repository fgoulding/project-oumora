The Dominion is controlled by the Sorcerers (who are direct descendants from creatures breading with Spirits).  This is very much middle english incest to keep the blood line pure.

The houses of Metis are the top sorcerer houses and hold all the power.

Additionally, there are exist a species of humanoid called shapechangers (reskin of Druid). The shape changers live kinda like second class citizens to the Socerers. they are used as military infantry even though they possess great power within themselves. there are some forces working against the Great Houses to usurp them. However most work with the houses in the constant battle against the [[Kainai Empire]]
