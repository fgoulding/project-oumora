Port Talon is a classic port city built into a peninsula of land the curves to form the shape of a Talon of a bird.

The western side of the town is protected by a natural wall/cliffside. The northern side of the town is equally elevated but acts as a wealthier neighborhood.

At the start of the peninsula is a large stone gate that acts to control entry into the town. There is little conflict so the gate, while manned, doesnt limit entry.

## Seafaring
The point of the talon is where the major port activity exists, though the entire eastern side is beach (where smaller vessels e.g. local fisherman take off at)

The port has a several docks which supports multiple large vessels.
