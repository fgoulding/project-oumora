No sleeping quarters and no tables, just a long oak bar with a dozen empty crates along it to sit on. The floor is uneven slate and the building itself is made of baked clay bricks mortared with rich orange clay.

An open fire pit behind the bar warms the room and the mugs to enhance the flavor of the brewmaster’s yarrow, marsh rosemary, and most recently, bog myrtle gruit.

 The brewmaster, a four century old Dwarven Cleric to Chauntea named _Cowlfjord Clan’Hearthstone_ claims his recipes come to him in his dreams directly from the goddess herself, but in reality, he just has a knack for finding flora that brews a tasty beverage.
