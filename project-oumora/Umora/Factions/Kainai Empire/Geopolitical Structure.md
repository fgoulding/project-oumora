Empire is the governing body. They act in all ways a monarch would rule in our world. So emperor is the head of the empire, likely has a a group of trusted advisors, managed taxes, etc. They rule over several regions within a large area
  
The citadel is physically like a university. It is full of citizens of the empire but is an independent military/research force of wizards. They are very tightly coupled and act in accordance to the emperor. However they might not fully agree or might have their own personal directives that are independent of the empire.
  
So if the empire goes to war, the citadel sends warships and wizards for combat. They research every aspect of wizardry. War casting is the highest tier of research.

There would also be silent tension between the empire and the citadel as the citadel holds a lot of firepower. Maybe more than the emperor would want. 

To the empire, They are an essential branch but one that needs to be kept in check. 
To the citadel, the empire is a source of funding and political protection.
