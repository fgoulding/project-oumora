## Description
The Drunken Manta is a dilapidated, rickety wood shanty is barely 20 feet square
The stools and tables are made from old barrels and crates. Its chandelier was an old captain's wheel. The stage curtains are old sails. Not a single part of the boat went to waste, they say. Local lore says its original inhabitants converted the ship so quickly that they were serving drinks and food - and renting rooms - while other tavern owners were still waiting for their foundations to dry. The place has changed hands a few times over the years, and nobody really remembers the original name of the ship. But a stool at the end of the bar - one that nobody dares to sit at - remains reserved for the captain (not that anyone even knows if he's still alive).
