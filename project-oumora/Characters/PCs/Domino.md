carried from another world
Spirit who lost his way to a new world.

### **Domino Timeline:** 

1. Lived in Umora as a pretty minor spirit, until being pulled into the forgotten realms by the chaotic good goddess of joy Llira - https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lliira

2. Was raised in a monastery as a disciple of Llira since his youth not having many friends. Learned how to make beer and wine, throw massive ragers, and got some acrobatic skills and clerical skills along the way. 

3. Left the Monastery to spread the word of Llira at the ripe age of 25, and kind of got side tracked, literally only a week into his "mission trip"

4. Ends up in jail to be rescued by the PCs from the previous campaign. So similar to the One Piece crew (pre time skip), even though they only spent a small amount of time together, they are loyal to each other and close friends. 

5. Campaign finishes and Domino is transferred back to Umora, with some pretty vague words from Llira on his way out. In this same moment Domino meets the spirit with may names and is quite confused by it all. 

6. Domino Lands in a village/town/city trying to find a way back to Faerun as he still has no memory of Umora or being a spirit. For all intents and purposes he might as well be a random cleric from another world. He tries to find a way back but ultimately loses his faith due to a lack of connection to his goddess Llira. 

7. Somewhat resigns himself to becoming a simple fisherman and or bartender with a reputation of being somewhat crazy due to always talking about another world and gods/goddesses (assuming is boarderline heretical in Umora), and his friends from another place. 

8. Gets picked up by new group through being associated with them in someway. They still think he is a crazy old man, but turns out to be pretty talented. 

  

**Thinking about a temporary alignment change for Domino during this period from chaotic good to chaotic neutral due to his loss of faith**

Also thinking about converting Domino to a lower level monk if his clerical powers don't work in Umora and they could be restored at some point once he finds out he is a spirit. 

  

  

### **Key Domino Plot Questions:** 

**Why did Llira bring a spirt from another world into Faerun? A few options:** 

1. She is a chaotic good deity so there doesn't really have to be a reason. Just thought it would be interesting to see how a being from another world would behave

2. She had some foresight and that having a spirit in Faerun would be useful in the long run, or having a spirit with knowledge and connections in Faerun would be useful in some upcoming conflict Umora. 

**What kind of Spirit is Domino?**

1. Drunkard Spirit that helps bozos find beer? 

	1. Spirit of the perfect pour? 

	2. Other potential beer spirits 

Option 2: 

	1. Fishing style spirit - Related to Naram in some way. 

	2. Helps fishermen hook set or find good fishing spots 

	3. Helps fishermen have patience (beer could fit here lol)

	4. Small fish spirit -- I kind of liked the pun Domino drinks like        a fish and ends up being a fish spirit

  
**How does he meet up with the rest of the group?**

1. Well known crazy person in his village or town

2. Is somewhat powerful and they want to enlist him?

3. They see him in the bar all the time? 

  **How does Domino find out Umora is his original home and he is some kind of spirit?**

1. to be discovered lol -- Will be very interesting in the story 

### **General Thoughts**

1. How is Faerun related to Umora 

	1. Gods are escaped spirits from the citadel starting a new world. 

	2. The citadel got so powerful that they are able to mask/ totally remove the power of the gods in their world. 

	3. Just two dimensions with very little interaction but recent experiments from the citadel have brought their worlds closer together. 

 One idea I've always loved is that the dimensions good and evil, and chaotic and lawful are equal. To the point where a chaotic good spirit and a chaotic evil spirit may work together to break up the monotony of the world. Would love to explore this with you since you shared you don't like the good and bad breakdown of traditional Dnd. 

  One idea I had for a campaign was that all the lawful gods good and evil split up the world to create "perfect stability and balance" (too balanced too lawful) while the chaotic gods good and evil team up to bring entropy back in the world. Liches, hobos, and radagast style folks work together to break the ordered machine that is formed. Would love to explore this with you since it sounds like the empire/citadel is quickly approaching this controlled "balance".
