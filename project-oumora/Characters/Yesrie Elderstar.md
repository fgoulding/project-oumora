Now we travel to the seas, just outside of port talon. To the the Splintered waters - a corvette that is sleek and fast. 4 canons line the port and starboard sides of the boat as a two thin green strips run the length of the boat.


You hear from the poop deck "Oi Comms, reefing the sails - we got a tailwind coming in strong. Let the captain know we are about "

The crew is busy
Allonzo is 
1. **Inspection**: Check for wear or damage due to weather, sun exposure, or enemy fire.
2. **Mending**: Sew any tears or holes on the sails, ensuring the stitching is strong and even to maintain the sail's integrity.
3. **Replacing**: Replace sections of a sail or an entire sail when repairs were no longer viable.
