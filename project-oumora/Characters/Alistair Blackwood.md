## Intro

As we move away from this cottage, over the forests and fields, past the ocean, far across on the other side Corith - the capital of the empire.

The sound of heavy intentional footsteps radiate through the massive Grey quartz halls. echos fill the tall 40ft ceilings as General Domino Chapman walks down the hall with seeming great intention and weight. Overhead cold blue light radiates from crystals overhead illuminating the hall, purchased from the citadel no doubt.  Pristine and immaculate - These halls seem both unnecessary and essential that even the medical center of the base looks opulent and expansive. Juxtaposed however with General Chapman - He dons green cargo pants that are so aged and worn that even the best tailor couldnt iron out the folds in his pants. The pants tucked into tall combat boots that seem to be laced but have no bow (an item of the citadel perhaps).  And he wears a large oversized safari shirt that looks equally worn. 

He stops abruptly turns a hard left and knocks on a wooden door.
