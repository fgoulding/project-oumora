Raven name: Enna
## Intro
 We move pp the winding roads through familiar trees in the pastoral, rolling hills, farmlands and cottages, deep thick forests with moss covered stone walls, patches of sunflower and corn, little hamlets gathered around a blacksmith shop or a little maypole in a dancing hall
 
Beautiful stars hang in the nighttime sky, celebrating the near full moon that shines light over a vast and endless rippling sea of treetops, whose leaves are cast in indigo by the pale moonlight. 

Wind moves over them, feeling of brisk chill air; the coming of winter. And in all of this silver and violet, there is one cradled point of warm and orange light emanating from the crosshatched and little dust covered windows of a humble Cottage out on the outskirts of the small town of Toema.

The cottage rests on the bend of a dirt road. The road hugs the edge of a not too steep ridge that goes down into the series of orchards and vineyards. Small farmhouses now even more sleepy and even more quiet as the nighttime has come, with beautiful little lined and stonewalled fields of peppers and grapes and tomatoes, all hanging there with harvest right around the corner.

Many in this village know that they are fortunate to live so near the cottage of a witch. Though, they know not the story of how this witch came to live here, nor how this witch came to find her apprentice.

The cottage is old and broad and welcoming, the deep rich brown of its high thatched roof that slopes down to hang over white plaster walls, and welcoming wooden beams.
Garden, rich flowers, the buzzing of bees, and the corner of a shrine up on top of the hill past the cottage. We see an old goat pen, and a garden shed, and a little foot path down to the stream that flows down past the hill, and a small footbridge over the stream that leads off into the deeper woods where many adventures were once had by the children who called this place home

Within the cottage; its familiar kitchen and fireplace, the workshop that faces the road, built up and around an old enclosure at the edge of the house. Large spinning wheel, and bottles of tinctures, and ointments, and hanging from the slightly sloped roof are bundled and dried flowers and herbs, and glass ornaments. Diamond patterned windows, just some of them slightly colored, a little amber or a little blue as the light comes in.
