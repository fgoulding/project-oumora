The tavern rests at the end of a flatiron block, even against the packed ground of city streets, you can see wheel ruts worked along side it. The roads leading up to the tavern divided rows of houses, shops, and factories - all now sleepy and quiet as the nighttime begins to fall, are all softly draped in ivy with age. The noise from the tavern is one of merry conversation, as the travelers who just reached this port town need to stop here for the night because the next city would be too far off on their journeys. Along with plenty of the villagers and fisherman here who have come to share a drink and a meal among friends in this public house.

You look out into the common room with the sort of rich pungent smell of pipe smoke that hangs and diffuses the light in this space, the candles that are lit and hanging from chandeliers and there's a big roaring fire in the fireplace. So it's a very smoke-filled room, although it's a sweet wood smoke mixed with tobacco. And you see that there is an old man wearing brown travelers' clothes.

He's got some sort of loose breeches, his boots sort of tied up with lace and cloth around his shins and he has a vest with many trinkets and ornaments hanging from it. He's got a couple of days stubble, a little bit of sallow skin - You can tell he is a kinda of travelling peddler

You can see because he's a storyteller and in this part of the world that's close enough to some kind of priest or holy man

Darren Bellhouse ushers you to go give the man some bread and soup
"Ha, a story teller brings good luck... in the form of money hahaha now go give him so food so that he may stay awhile"

Ohoho have i seen the other side of the sea? I've seen the wide oceans and I've seen the far off seas of Iska and Metis. I've seen the inner seas beyond the ily - 

~ this is a huge deal - people come to the port but they are either on business.

You certainly didn't think that this was the only world there was, did you? No, no. This is not the only world. [Laughing] It's not even the first. There was a world before this one, children
