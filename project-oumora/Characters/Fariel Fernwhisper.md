## Intro

My parents were **farmers** and as a child, my **twin brother Finnegan** and I would wander around our farm and one day came across a bundle of weird-looking herbs. My mom told me to bring it to the local apothecary to identify - they told me it was a rare herb and offered me 5 gold per bundle. 

I gathered more rare herbs and word got around to the local witches who offered me a magic artifact to find an even rarer herb for their potions. I ventured high and low on the farms and later the woods and eventually found it, then sold the magic artifact to the highest bidder.

I built a reputation for being the go-to person for acquiring rare items in exchange for gold, favors, or other artifacts, then slowly shifted to acquiring information - my short and stealthy nature made it easy for me to slip in and out of places and being a **halfling** allowed me infiltrate different circles without much attention. A local assassin took notice of these qualities, along with my discretion dealing goods and currying favor with the locals, and decided to take me under her wing. 

I continued my black market network and eventually opened up a small shopfront (**Finnegan’s Antiques, Herbs, and Other Curiosities!** Named after my brother) and in the hidden basement, I house all of my black market goods. The secret phrase for the black market is “are you going to the night market” and the secret phrase for assassin for hire is “I’m looking for a rare blue nightshade”. I have a code of honor for my assassinations: No child, no innocent, no common folk.
